## Why does it get flagged?
Because i dont have spare money to bribe Microsoft. (i would need to buy a license).

## This doesnt get flagged as a virus for me, is there something wrong with my antivirus?
No.. (probably)
you either use a very good antivirus that will actually double check if the file is a virus, or your antivirus doesnt detect shit lmaooooo
